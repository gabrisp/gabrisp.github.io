    # This could be a simple number field.
    # For this example we use a global storage with different tax rates. In this case there is a `default` and a `reduced` tax which is defined in `site/config/config.php`. The key (`default` or `reduced`) is stored in the tax field. Because of this we need to transform the `key` (e.g. `reduced ) into a number field (e.g. `7`) with the help of Page Models. (see `site/models/product.php` and `site/models/product-variant.php`).
    # Why do we want this? When the tax for products with reduced tax rate changes (e.g. from 7 to 5) we only have to change this in one place. Otherwise we would need to change the tax for every product.
